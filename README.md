### A Kuramoto Model Approach to Predicting Chaotic Systems with Echo State Networks
## By Sophie Wu, Jackson Howe, Lyle Muller

# Description
Our [2022 paper](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/usri/usri2022/ReOS/70/) creates an echo state network (ESN) with a network and activation function based on the [Kuramoto Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model). Our model successfully predicts the logistic map chaotic system for a nontrivial number of time steps (~30). We comment on the similarity between the KuramotoESN and another widely known physical model, the Ising model.
